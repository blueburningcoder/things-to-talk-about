    Rationality is the quality or state of being rational â€“ that is, being
    based on or agreeable to reason. \\

    "Rationality" has different specialized meanings in philosophy,
    economics, sociology, psychology, evolutionary biology, game theory and
    political science.

        \item Everything that can help you
        \item Extreme take on effectiveness
        \item When in a competition with someone else, I want to be more effective
        \item Everything, to ultimately \newline \textbf{achieve your goals}
    \end{itemize}
    \pnote{yes, EVERYTHING, and if a deal with the devil would allow us to
    achieve them, then we'll take that shortcut, obviously. Even if you have
    constraints, say, you want to achieve your goal but without making a deal
    with the devil. Might be better, since it's really hard to meet with the
    devil nowadays. Any one of his subcontractors should do for most goals.}
