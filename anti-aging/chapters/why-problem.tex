    \pnote{
        Corona deaths correlate strongly with age \\
        \par
        Infection is mostly detected through symptoms \\
        no detection of many infections in aged <20

    Same with all other primary causes!

        Similarly, these diseases are not \\
        life-threathening when young! only old \\

    And yet it receives less than 1/100th of Funding!

        Curing Cancer completely: about 4Y \\
        Curing Heart Diseases: about 4.5Y \\
        Curing both: about 7Y \\

        Slowing down aging: by the amount slowed down \\
        also healthspan, not just lifespan! \\
