\section{Where can Bioinformatics Help?}
\subsection{Analysis}

\begin{frame}[c]{Analysis}
    \large
    Large datasets, ever-more data

    \begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]
        \item Every medical database getting larger (picture would be great)
        \item Countries started biobanks (Denmark, UK, ...) (check for source)
        \item No one attempts analysis: no one has approrpiate tools!
        \item needed: correlating genes with injuries/health problems/allergies over lifetime 
        \item new tools, new bigger better software and comp capacity
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\subsection{Simulation}

\begin{frame}[c]{Simulation}
    current Pharmaceutical battle: better simulator (find source with details or picture)
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Simulation II}
    AlphaFold2 and others are getting better and better
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Simulation: Impact}
    
    \begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]
        \item cheaper preliminary analysis
        \item identification of missing or additional effect pathways
        \item faster research iterations
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
