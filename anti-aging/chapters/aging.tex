    \begin{block}{Definition \cite{sen2016epigenetic}}
        Aging is characterized by progressive decline in tissue and organ
        function and increased risk of mortality.

    But how can we measure it?

\subsection{Problematic: Many Unknowns}

\begin{frame}[c]{Problem: Many Theories}
    \large
    \begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]
        \item Everything is interlinked
        \item Very hard to distinguish cause and effect
        \item At least one Theory for every Hallmark
        \item Every prestigious lab has its own Theory
        \item A lot of speculation on all sides
        \item Unclear if we can already see the full picture
        \item More research is needed
    \end{itemize}
