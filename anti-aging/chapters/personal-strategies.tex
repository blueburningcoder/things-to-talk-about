\begin{frame}[c]{Pharmacological}
    Some medicaments: Not medical advice!

    \begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]
        \item Metformin - calorie restriction mimetic that controls blood sugar
        \item Quercetin - anti-aging flavenoid that acts as a senolytic
        \item Resveratrol - sirtuin enzyme activator and calorie restriction mimetic
        \item Vitamin D - blood tested to optimize, ideally 2000IU per day
        \item Vitamin B12 - as many people are deficient
    \end{itemize}


    On the more extreme end (for older people or people with a higher risk tolerance):

    \begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]
        \item Rapamycin - an mTOR inhibitor that attenuates senescence
        \item NAD-boosters such as NMN and NR - enhancers of stem cell function
        \item Dasatinib - a senolytic usually used in combination with quercetin
    \end{itemize}
