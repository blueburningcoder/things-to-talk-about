    There's a qualitative general pattern that various kinds of physiological
        stress - exposure to radiation or harsh chemicals (including smoking),
        chronic infection, malnutrition, sleep deprivation, etc - tend to
        accelerate aging.

        \item Increase in damaged proteins/DNA/fats
        \item Inflammation

    Most severe illnesses cause the 'aging clock' to speed up. Most diseases of
    aging have similar characteristics. This is direct evidence that there are
    {\em few underlying root causes} for aging.

\begin{frame}[c]{Method Evaluation: Parabiosis}
    \large
    % Parabiosis (heterochronic parabiosis) is putting young blood into old mice, to make the old mice biologically younger. This is achieved in the lab by connecting the circulatory systems of young mice and old mice. Certain factors in the blood help to rejuvenate muscle, heart brain and liver tissues in old mice and restore their biological function.

% Equivalent procedures that modify the compounds within blood in humans such as apheresis (blood filtering) could be used to slow aging in humans and thereby prevent or slow the progression of many types of age-related diseases including Alzheimer's disease.

% Recently, a group of Russian biohackers recently took part in the first plasma dilution experiments in humans. In a research context, the safety and effectiveness of apheresis is being tested in a clinical trial in humans by the company Alkahest.

    \textbf{Hallmarks affected}:
    \begin{aquote}{\cite{conese2017fountain}}
        In principle, the heterochonic parabiosis reverts all phenotypic and molecular hallmarks of ageing by transferring soluble factors and cells.
