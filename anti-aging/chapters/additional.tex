    \large
    \begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]
        \item 'Premature aging', median age of death: 47
        \item Autosomal Recessive (does not affect carrier)
        \item Caused by mutation in WRN gene
        \item WRN important for DNA-Repair, especially after oxidative damage \cite{szekely2005werner}
    \end{itemize}

    Study with mice injected restriction enzyme activate with drug to induce
    repeated DNA damage, they age considerably faster. Same with knocking out SIRT1 and others
