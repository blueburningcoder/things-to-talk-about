[Introduction]

Slide 1:
 - dna is around 2m long
 - dna compressed in cells
 - picture shows such a contact matrix
 - nothing in nature is happening randomly


Slide 2:
 - look at the roadmap
 - first explain how we can get such a contact matrix
 - these methods have certain biases, so we want to correct them
 - one such algorithm is presented in the ICE section
 - It was implemented in Rust so I'll give a quick introduction to that
 - how the integration from python with rust worked out
 - results of this implementation with the previous ones
 - then we will already get to the conclusion about this work


Slide 3:
 - First, let us start with this method to get the contact matrix


Slide 4:
 - First we link all the contacting ends
 - then we break the genome apart at certain points with a restriction enzyme
 - we reconnect the parts that have not been connected before, and add biotin, to filter them later
 - we unlink them, since they are also connected now
 - These sequences are still to long for sequencing, so we break them apart by sonication with ultrasonic waves
 - we filter for those fragments with biotin and sequence

    Biases for each step:
     - Some regions do easier biotin labeling than others
     - PCR artifacts are included
     - Sequencing itself has multiple biases
     - Where to map multiple/unclear reads ?
     - differing chromatin states
     - more ...
