Stuff/Concepts I want to include at some point:

- Amortisation (in detail)
- Strategy is Long-Term-Planning
- Finite games vs infinite games
- English version
- Strategic Thought patterns (how to learn more from failure)
    (how can I avoid this systematic class of failures)
- Direct Consequences.
- My own design(s).
- Responsibility - or rather another talk?
- Discipline - or rather another talk?
