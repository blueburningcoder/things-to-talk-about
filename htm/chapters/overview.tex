\begin{frame}[c]{Attributes of HTM Algorithms}
    \begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]
        \item can store, learn, infer and recall higher-order sequences
        \item learns unsupervised time-based patterns in unlabeled data on continuous streams
        \item robust against noise
        \item can learn multiple patterns at once
        \item suited for prediction, anomaly detection, classification
        \item tested and implemented in software
        \item commercially used (anomaly detection, NLP)
    \end{itemize}
