% TODO:

% Include Topics/Facts:
%
% - explain reticular activating system
% - explain gradient for Autism and that it is more 'bottom up'
% - explain 'top-down' phenomena and common biases
% - explain theory: inhibited-boost: hallucination

% Roadmap (?)
%
% - Introduce HTMv3 !
% - Motor movements are just very strong predictions the body 'makes happen'
%   - Flow state is where everything is exactly as predicted
% - Mistakes that happen by accidential correlation: search for good example; mistaking something to be true
% - explain gradient for Einstein/Craziness, proving vs disproving in the brain -> THC is bad
% - Mistakes that happen by top-down enforcing (e.g. the dalmatine picture, scrambled words)
% - Location-based composition: This explains mind palaces!
% - Everything is a 'conceptspace' -

% - Explain Priming based on predictive stuff (the priming-bias)
% - Explain biases based on these models
% - Explain the fact that smarter people have less Brain activity
% - Explain the bayesian-reasioning part
% - Explain how cortical columns create quite powerful models
% - Phantom limb 'pain' -> boosting
% - AHA-Moment (aligning models, ceasing bursting)
% - requiring more resources during learning
